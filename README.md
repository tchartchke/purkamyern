# Purkamyern

An empty CLI pokedex, all set up and ready for you to go on your own adventure! Pokemon are pretty simple and pretty much say their name all the time so keep an ear out, and when you hear it loud and clear, add it into your dex! Let's go on a wild safari journey!

## Installation

## Development

Using Paul Hallett's [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
