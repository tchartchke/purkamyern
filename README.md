# Purkamyern

Imagine you’ve just turned 10 and some weird professor gives you a Pokédex, sending you out to collect data for him. You go wondering around in some tall grass and hear a Pokémon calling its own name (Yes, the sound a Pokémon makes is it’s species name. How simple and convenient). Time to scan it into your Pokédex and see some information about it! You can also use it to look up Pokémon that you already have saved into your Pokédex.
